Format the data in the Date_Visited column to have a consistent “dd-mmm-yyyy” format



you may need to manually change the number format for some previously entered dates if they aren’t automatically recognized. To do so, select those cells and choose Format > Number > Date from the menu.


After changing your locale, any dates already entered into the Sheet will be automatically translated to the date format of the locale you chose, and any date values that you insert after this point will match the conventions of that location. And remember: This change only applies to this one spreadsheet.



From the “Locale” drop-down menu, select an alternative location. For instance, setting the locale to “United Kingdom” will switch your spreadsheet to the “DD/MM/YYYY” format and set the default currency to GBP, and so on.

To change the default date format to “MM/DD/YYYY,” set the Locale value to “United States” or another region that uses that format. To save the change, click “Save Settings.”
