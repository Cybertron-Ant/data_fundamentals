Below is the syntax of the FILTER function:

FILTER(range, condition1, [condition2, â€¦]):

range: This is the range of cells that you want to filter.

condition1: This is the columns/row (corresponding to the column/row of the dataset), that returns an array of TRUEs/FALSES. This needs to be of the same size as that of the range

[condition2]: This is an optional argument and can be the second condition for which you check in the formula. This again can be a column/row (corresponding to the column/row of the dataset), that returns an array of TRUEs/FALSES. This needs to be of the same size as that of the range.
